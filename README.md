# 🎮 Godot Studies  

A personal documentation and progress tracker for my journey learning **Godot Engine**.  
Here I’ll be sharing notes, projects, and milestones as I practice game development.

## 📌 Projects  

### 1. Gem Catcher  
My very first Godot project!  
A simple game where the player catches falling gems — built to understand the basics of scenes, nodes, and scripting.
